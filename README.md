**Binary Input to Quantum Circuit Transformation**

This repository provides a simple yet illustrative example of transforming binary input into a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The code constructs a quantum circuit based on a binary string input, applying X gates and controlled-X (CX) gates according to the binary pattern provided. This repository serves as a helpful resource for those interested in exploring how classical binary information can be mapped onto quantum states.

### Key Features
- **Binary to Quantum Transformation**: The code accepts a binary string input and initializes a quantum circuit with corresponding qubits, applying X gates to set up the initial state.
- **Controlled Operations**: It utilizes controlled-X (CX) gates to create entanglement or conditional operations based on the input binary string.
- **Circuit Visualization**: The quantum circuit is drawn at different stages for a clear visual representation of the transformation process.
- **Qiskit-Based**: Utilizes Qiskit, an open-source framework for quantum computing, for circuit manipulation and visualization.

### Code Overview
1. **Input**: Accepts a binary string (e.g., `1101`) where each '1' represents an X gate applied to the corresponding qubit.
2. **Quantum Circuit Creation**: Initializes a quantum circuit with as many qubits as the length of the input.
3. **X Gates Application**: Sets the qubits to the specified binary state by applying X gates to qubits corresponding to '1's in the input.
4. **Controlled-X Gates**: Sequentially applies CX gates, with each qubit controlling the last qubit to demonstrate conditional quantum operations.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit
   ```
3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   *Input a binary string when prompted.*

### Requirements
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Qiskit** for quantum circuit operations and visualization

This repository is ideal for students and beginners interested in quantum computing who want to learn how binary information can be mapped to quantum circuits using Qiskit. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
