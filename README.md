# Binary-Input-to-Quantum-Circuit-Transformation
This repository provides a Qiskit-based script that converts a binary string into a quantum circuit. X and CX gates are applied based on the input, visualizing binary-to-quantum mapping. Ideal for beginners exploring basic quantum operations and Qiskit.
